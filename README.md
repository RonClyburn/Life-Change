# Life Change Church

This is a website that I designed and developed for my local church, Life Change Church. Thank you for looking!

## Overview
This was a fun challenge that allowed me to branch out and create a full website. I learned numerous things about HTML and CSS and also integrated some JavaScript elements as well to make the navigation menu have more functionality. 
I began this project by designing how I would want the websiste to look when fully complete. Being that most users today use cell phones to surf the internet I built the page with a mobile first approach by using smaller screen sizes in my browsers developer tools. I then used media queries to be able to switch page layouts when the screen hits a desired size.
