# Life Change Church

This is a website that I designed and developed for my local church, Life Change Church. Thank you for looking!

## Overview
This was a fun challenge that allowed me to branch out and create a full website in which I learned numerous things about HTML and CSS. I also used this project to integrate some JavaScript elements to make the navigation menu have more functionality such as opening up or closing a mobile navigation menu when clicked.

I began this project by designing how I would want the websiste to look when fully complete and began to peice together the elements based on that reference. Being that most users today use cell phones to surf the internet, I built the page with a mobile first approach by using smaller screen sizes in my browsers developer tools to ensure high quality at that size. I then used media queries to be able to switch page layouts when the screen hits a desired size to allow for a positive user experience no matter what device screen size is used.
